THE "HOT CHOCOLATE LICENSE ‚òï" (HCL revision 1312.2):

OniriCorpe wrote this file. As long as you retain this
notice and you are an anarchist/communist who supports oppressed and
marginalized groups (ie and not exclusively queer folks, BIPOC, intersex,
disabled comrades, etc), you can do whatever you want with this stuff.
If we meet some day, and you think this stuff is worth it, you can buy me a
hot chocolate or any other non-alcoholic drink that suits me in return.
